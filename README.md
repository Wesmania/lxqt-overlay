The current purpose of this repo is to host a newer obconf-qt package, so that its files don't collide with lxqt-l10n. In the future I might drop other lxqt packages here, either as new versions or fixes to ones in Gentoo repo.

Some day I might try making this an official layman overlay, or maybe maintaining this in Gentoo repo. For now, and for my convenience, anything thrown in here will have no obligation to always work or be stable (except for rewriting repo history).
